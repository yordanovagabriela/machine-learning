# Machine Learning

The repo contains exercises and homeworks I have done as part of the courses:
- [Machine Learning by Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
- [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science ](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/)

### Extra readings and materials I've found useful:

- [A Neural Network in 13 lines of Python (Part 2 - Gradient Descent)](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/27/python-network-part2/)
- [Stanford Notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/)
- [Efficient BackProp](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf)
- [Deep Sparse Rectifier Neural Networks](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v15/glorot11a/glorot11a.pdf)
- [A list of cost functions used in neural networks, alongside applications](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/154879/a-list-of-cost-functions-used-in-neural-networks-alongside-applications)

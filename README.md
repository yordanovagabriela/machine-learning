# Machine Learning

The repo contains exercises and homeworks I have done as part of the courses:
- [Machine Learning by Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
- [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science ](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/)

### Extra readings and materials I've found useful:
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)
- [A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python (Part 1)](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/)
- [A Neural Network in 13 lines of Python (Part 2 - Gradient Descent)](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/27/python-network-part2/)
